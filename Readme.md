# generating a random walk for multiple armed bandit tasks
1. We start to generate the random-walk by assigning random starting points samples from a uniform distribution  between the two bounds.

2. We then calculate the next value in each arm to be equal to what it was plus some noise. noise is samples from a multivariate distribution with a mean of 0, and variance
calculate sigma matrix for a multivariate normal distribution according to tau and rho
